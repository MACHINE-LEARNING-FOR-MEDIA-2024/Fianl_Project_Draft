Based on this observation, I decided to further test the performance of a pre-built model, such as a Random Forest classifier, to see how it performs. One possible reason why the Random Forest classifier worked so well is that the original images are PNG files without a background, whereas the generated images include a background.\n",

In contrast, for images like Pikachu that contain fewer red or purple tones, the results appear clearer compared to those with more red or purple tones.\n",

    "The model still works well when the original image change from the transparent background into the white one as the generated files. Thus, I do not think the background is the reason that the classifier works so well. In contrast, according to the result of pca and the manual classifier I remain to the assumption that this is because the original images and the generated images use the color purple differently. The following session, I would use HW12 as a template to try the tensor to see if that works."
